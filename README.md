## Project One - Onboarding
For this project, we are creating a single-page site that features some sort of sign-up process to try and convince new users some type of project group. The primary goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for something that we're offering, which is difficult especially when you're asking for personal information.
### Project One Goals
* Create a touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive web design
* Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience
* Design and execute a progressively enhanced page focused on system users and tasks
* Apply design principles including typography, layout, color, and material design
* Engage in agile, iterative web design and development, supported by version control
