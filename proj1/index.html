        <p>
          Originally formed in 2013, Illinois Tech Esports is an established, non-profit collegiate esports organization that has quickly grown to be seen as a regional leader known for its community focus and high-quality events. On August 22, 2018, we unveiled the Esports and Digital Arts Center to the campus community to open up new avenues of educations through topics surrounding esports, such as game design and VR simulation.
