        <p>
          Originally formed in 2013, Illinois Tech Esports is an established, non-profit collegiate esports organization that has quickly grown to be seen as a regional leader known for its community focus and high-quality events. Originally called "Scarlet League", the club was focused for students interested in League of Legends. In 2017, the club expanded to support even more titles, such as Overwatch, Hearthstone, CS:GO, and Rocket League.

          On August 22, 2018, the club unveiled the Esports and Digital Arts Center to the campus community to open up new avenues of education through topics surrounding esports, such as game design and VR simulation.
